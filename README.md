# HackAssembler

Python implementation of the nand2tetris' Hack Assembler Program. Build for
project 6 of the nand2tetris course on coursera.

## Goal

Develop an assembler that translates programs written in Hack assembly
language into the binary code understood by the Hack hardware platform.

## Requirements

* Parse the Hack Assembly code file (*.asm)  
* Handle whitespaces
* Handle comments:
    1. Line comments
    2. Inline comments
* Must be able to translate two types of instructions:
    1. A-instruction
    2. C-instruction
* Must be able to track symbols and labels
* Write the generated code into a file (*.hack)


## Proposed API

* `Parser` module: Encapsulates access to the input code. Reads an assembly language command, parses it, and provides convenient access to the commandâ€™s components
(fields and symbols). In addition, removes all white space and comments.

* `Code` module
* `Main` module
* Use a `HashTable` to handle symbols and labels

## My Thoughts

1. This project is a good programming exercise.
2. I will use it to practice TDD and Unit Testing.
3. I will use `unittest` module of Python.
